  %p
    %b Community Guidelines
  %p
    The intent of this document is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable use of Tecknoworks, S.R.L (“Tecknoworks,” “we” or “us”) website,
    %a{href: 'http://tecknoworks.com'} http://tecknoworks.com
    (the “Site”), Tecknoworks’s CityReport mobile application (“CityReportApp”) and website
    %a{href: 'http://cityreportapp.com'} http://www.cityreportapp.com
    (“AppWebsite”)(this application together with the Site and AppWebsite, the “Service”). Redundant Content. Service is not intended to be an all-purpose content aggregator. Users who import or aggregate content in a less-than-meaningful way are likely to be suspended. Illegal Use. Service may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Service for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information). Spam. Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will be suspended. Identity Theft and Privacy. Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other people’s personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s and other license numbers. You may not post information such as other people’s passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web. Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel. Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement Copyright. Sexually Explicit Content. Users that regularly upload sexually explicit or pornographic material will be blocked. Malicious Bigotry. Don’t actively promote violence or extreme hatred against individuals or groups, on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. While we firmly believe that the best response to hateful speech is not censorship but more speech, we will take down malicious bigotry, as defined here. Harm to Minors. Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor. Don’t post anything relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Don’t bully minors, even if you are one. Life as a teenager is hard enough without the fear, anguish, and isolation caused by online bullying. Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm. Don’t post content that actively promotes or glorifies self-harm. This includes content that urges or encourages readers to cut or injure themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or joining together in supportive conversation with those suffering or recovering from depression or other conditions. Dialogue about these behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult conditions. Gore and Mutilation Content. Don’t post gore just to be shocking. Don’t showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals, or their remains. Mass Registration and Automation. Don’t register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or programmatically. Unauthorized Sweepstakes or Giveaways. Everyone wants to be a winner, but there are many reasons (including legal ones) why Service can’t be used for sweepstakes without our involvement and consent. If you’re planning something like this, let us know. Copyright and Trademark Infringement. Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. If you aren’t authorized to use someone else’s copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don’t. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Impersonation, Stalking, or Harassment. Treat the community the way you’d like to be treated. Don’t attempt to circumvent the Block feature. If you want to parody or ridicule a public figure (and who doesn’t?), don’t try to trick readers into thinking you are actually that public figure. Privacy Violations. Don’t use CityReportApp to deceptively obtain personal information. Don’t post content that violates anyone’s privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, unlisted contact information, or private photos of your ex’s junk (no matter how attractive). Disruptions, Exploits, and Resource Abuse. Our servers and the valiant engineers that support them work hard for you. Don’t attempt unauthorized use, disruption, or exploitation of CityReportApp or our other products and CityReportApp, or otherwise abuse CityReportApp’s resources. Unlawful Uses and Content. This one’s pretty obvious, but CityReportApp is not a place for illegal behavior, including fraud, phishing, or illegally inciting violence. Account Termination If we conclude you are violating these policies, you may receive a notice via email. If you don’t explain or correct your behavior, your account may be suspended and/or your User ID may be blocked. We do our best to ensure fair outcomes, but in all cases we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these policies in our sole discretion, and these policies don’t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner. We also reserve the right to amend these policies.

    %b Information We Collect
  %p
    %b Personal Information
  %p We generally collect very little information that personally identifies you, such as your mobile telephone number. We also have you create a username and password. You may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register within the mobile application. The decision to provide this information is voluntary. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you will not be able to use the mobile application Services.
  %p
    %b Usage Data
  %p We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user but allows us to collect information regarding how users access and use Services (“Usage Data”). For example, when you download and use Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device vendor identifier. Additionally, each time you use the Site, we automatically collect information regarding the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site and to enhance and update the Services. We may ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications or Services. Your permission to our access to and tracking of your location based information is purely voluntary, and, accordingly, you may freely opt-in of or opt-out of and determine the level of specificity of the same.
  %p
    %b Message Data
  %p When you send or receive messages using our Services, we may temporarily process and store your messages, log and contact data, and other related information (“Message Data”) in order to provide these Services to you. Although we strive to delete your Message Data as soon as the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee that the Message Data will be completely deleted. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that the Message Data will be deleted and therefore any Message Data that you send is sent at your own risk.
